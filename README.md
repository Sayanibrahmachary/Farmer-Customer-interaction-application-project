# AgriConnect
## Description
Farmer-Customer Interaction System is a web-based platform that connects local farmers directly with customers, eliminating middlemen and promoting fair trade. The system enables farmers to list their products, interact with buyers, and manage orders, while customers can browse available produce, communicate with sellers, and make informed purchases. This project aims to support local agriculture, ensure better pricing for farmers, and provide consumers with fresh, farm-sourced products through a simple and effective digital solution.
