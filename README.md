## Future Plans
   - Expand the platform beyond just vegetables — allowing housewives and small-scale producers to sell homemade items like ghee, pickles, spices, and other local products.
   - Create separate sections within the platform for different product categories (e.g., Vegetables, Dairy, Homemade Items, etc.) to improve browsing and discovery.
   - Integrate an in-app chat or messaging system so customers and farmers can communicate in real-time for queries, custom orders, and better trust.
   - Build a mobile application version of the platform (Android & iOS) for broader accessibility, especially for farmers in rural areas with smartphones.
## Conclusion
 - The Farmer-Customer Interaction System is a meaningful step toward creating a fair, transparent, and efficient digital marketplace for agricultural and homemade products. By directly connecting farmers and small-scale producers with consumers, the platform empowers local communities, supports sustainable trade, and eliminates dependency on middlemen.
 - This project not only solves real-world problems but also opens doors for future innovations — from expanding product categories to enabling real-time communication and mobile access. Overall, it showcases how technology can be used to uplift rural economies while offering convenience and quality to consumers.
